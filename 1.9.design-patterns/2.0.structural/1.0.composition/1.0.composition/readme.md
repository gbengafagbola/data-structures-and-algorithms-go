# **Composition in Go (Struct Embedding & Interface Composition)**

## **Introduction**
Composition is a design principle that allows us to build complex structures by **combining smaller, reusable components** rather than relying on inheritance. In **Go**, composition is achieved using **struct embedding** and **interface implementation**, which makes code more **flexible and modular**.

This repository demonstrates **composition** using different approaches in **Go**, including:
- **Struct embedding**
- **Interface composition**
- **Function pointers for dynamic behavior**

---

## **Example 1: Athlete and Swimmer Composition**
### **Scenario**
We want to represent a **swimmer** who can also **train** like an athlete. Instead of creating a large inheritance tree, we use **composition** to combine behaviors.

### **Implementation**
```go
package composition

// Athlete struct with a Train method
type Athlete struct{}

// Train prints a training message
func (a *Athlete) Train() {
	println("Training")
}

// Swim function (not part of a struct) prints a swimming message
func Swim() {
	println("Swimming!")
}

// CompositeSwimmerA embeds an Athlete and has a pointer to a Swim function
type CompositeSwimmerA struct {
	MyAthlete Athlete // Athlete capabilities (training)
	MySwim    *func() // Pointer to a swim function
}
```
### **Explanation**
- The **`Athlete` struct** has a `Train()` method.
- `Swim()` is a **standalone function** that can be assigned dynamically.
- `CompositeSwimmerA` **embeds `Athlete`** (to reuse its functionality) and stores a **pointer to `Swim`**, allowing for flexible behavior.

---

## **Example 2: Interface Composition**
### **Scenario**
We now want to implement a **more flexible swimmer** that can both **train** and **swim**, but we don't want to force it to inherit from a specific type.

### **Implementation**
```go
// Trainer interface represents an entity that can train
type Trainer interface {
	Train()
}

// Swimmer interface represents an entity that can swim
type Swimmer interface {
	Swim()
}

// SwimmerImplementor provides a concrete implementation of the Swimmer interface
type SwimmerImplementor struct{}

// Swim prints a swimming message
func (s *SwimmerImplementor) Swim() {
	println("Swimming!")
}

// CompositeSwimmerB embeds Trainer and Swimmer interfaces
// This allows it to have both training and swimming capabilities
type CompositeSwimmerB struct {
	Trainer // Embedded interface for training
	Swimmer // Embedded interface for swimming
}
```
### **Explanation**
- **Interfaces (`Trainer` & `Swimmer`)** define separate behaviors.
- `SwimmerImplementor` **implements the `Swimmer` interface**.
- `CompositeSwimmerB` embeds **both interfaces**, allowing it to have **multiple capabilities dynamically**.

This approach is **more flexible** than struct embedding because any type implementing `Trainer` and `Swimmer` can be composed into `CompositeSwimmerB`.

---

## **Example 3: Shark as a Composed Entity**
### **Scenario**
We want to define a **shark** that **eats like an animal** and **swims differently** based on dynamic behavior.

### **Implementation**
```go
// Animal struct with a basic Eat method
type Animal struct{}

// Eat prints an eating message
func (r *Animal) Eat() {
	println("Eating")
}

// Shark struct embeds Animal and has a Swim function
type Shark struct {
	Animal     // Inherits Eat() method
	Swim func() // Function pointer for swimming behavior
}
```
### **Explanation**
- `Shark` **embeds `Animal`**, so it automatically **inherits** the `Eat()` method.
- Instead of forcing a single swim behavior, we use **a function pointer (`Swim func()`)**, allowing different sharks to swim in **different ways**.

---

## **Extra Example: Vehicles and Features**
### **Scenario**
We want to design a system where a **vehicle** can have different features, such as an **engine** and a **radio**, without using deep inheritance.

### **Implementation**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Engine struct with Start method
type Engine struct{}

func (e *Engine) Start() {
	fmt.Println("Engine started")
}

// Radio struct with PlayMusic method
type Radio struct{}

func (r *Radio) PlayMusic() {
	fmt.Println("Playing music")
}

// Car struct embeds Engine and Radio, allowing it to have both functionalities
type Car struct {
	Engine // Car has an engine
	Radio  // Car has a radio
}

func main() {
	myCar := Car{}
	myCar.Start()     // Calls Engine's Start method
	myCar.PlayMusic() // Calls Radio's PlayMusic method
}
```
### **Explanation**
- `Car` **embeds `Engine` and `Radio`**, automatically gaining their methods (`Start()` and `PlayMusic()`).
- This is **composition over inheritance** because we **combine** behaviors instead of forcing a rigid hierarchy.

## **Why Use Composition Over Inheritance?**
| Feature           | Inheritance (Not Used) | Composition (Used Here) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Code Reusability | High but rigid         | High and flexible       |
| Flexibility      | Low (tight coupling)   | High (loose coupling)   |
| Scalability      | Hard to extend         | Easy to modify          |
| Method Sharing   | Forced via hierarchy   | Shared via embedding    |
| Go Idiomatic?    | ‚ùå No                   | ‚úÖ Yes                   |

**Go prefers composition over inheritance** because:
- It **avoids deep class hierarchies** (which are hard to maintain).
- It **makes code more modular** and reusable.
- It **allows dynamic behavior** using function pointers.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Struct embedding** allows **code reuse** (e.g., `Athlete` in `CompositeSwimmerA`).
- **Interface composition** allows **flexibility** (e.g., `Trainer` & `Swimmer` in `CompositeSwimmerB`).
- **Function pointers** allow **dynamic behavior** (e.g., `Shark` with `Swim func()`).
- **Composition makes code more maintainable** compared to inheritance.

By using composition, we can **mix and match functionalities** in a way that is **scalable and idiomatic to Go**. üöÄ
