# Explanation of Singleton Pattern

## What is a Singleton?
A singleton is a design pattern that ensures only **one instance** of a particular class (or struct in Go) exists in the program. All references to the singleton point to the same instance.

## Why use a Singleton?
It is useful for managing shared resources like:

- **Database connections**
- **Logging mechanisms**
- **Caching systems**
- **Configuration settings**

## How does this code implement Singleton?
- `instance` is a **global variable** that holds the single instance.
- `GetInstance()` checks if `instance` is `nil`:
  - If `nil`, it creates a new instance.
  - If not `nil`, it returns the existing instance.
- This ensures that every call to `GetInstance()` returns the **same instance**.

## Potential Issue: Not Thread-Safe
This implementation is **not thread-safe**. If multiple goroutines call `GetInstance()` at the same time, it could create multiple instances. A better approach is to use `sync.Once` to ensure only one instance is created:

```go
import "sync"

var once sync.Once

func GetInstance() *singleton {
	once.Do(func() { // Ensures this block executes only once
		instance = new(singleton)
	})
	return instance
}
```

This ensures **thread safety** and prevents multiple instances from being created in concurrent execution.
