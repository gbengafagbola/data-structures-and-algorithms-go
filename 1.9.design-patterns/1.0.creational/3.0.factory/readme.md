Hereâ€™s an example of a `README.md` file that describes your Go project, particularly the payment method functionality.

# Payment Method Example

This Go package demonstrates a simple creational pattern for handling different payment methods, such as Cash and Debit Card. The main purpose of this package is to provide a clean and extendable way to manage various payment methods by using interfaces and constants.

## Package Overview

The package defines a `PaymentMethod` interface and two concrete implementations: `CashPM` and `DebitCardPM`. Each implementation provides its own version of the `Pay` method, which processes a payment for the specified amount.

### Key Features:
- **PaymentMethod Interface**: Defines the `Pay` method that all payment methods must implement.
- **Cash and DebitCard Payment Methods**: Concrete implementations of the `PaymentMethod` interface, each implementing its own version of the `Pay` method.
- **Flexible Method Retrieval**: `GetPaymentMethod` allows you to obtain a payment method based on an integer identifier (e.g., `1` for Cash, `2` for DebitCard).

## How It Works

### PaymentMethod Interface

The `PaymentMethod` interface is the key component. Any type that implements the `Pay` method will be considered a valid payment method.

```go
type PaymentMethod interface {
	Pay(amount float32) string
}
```

### Payment Methods

- **CashPM**: Implements the `PaymentMethod` interface for payments made via cash.
- **DebitCardPM**: Implements the `PaymentMethod` interface for payments made via debit card.

Each type has its own `Pay` method that returns a string describing the payment method used and the amount paid.

```go
func (c *CashPM) Pay(amount float32) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Paid %.2f using Cash", amount)
}

func (d *DebitCardPM) Pay(amount float32) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Paid %.2f using Debit Card", amount)
}
```

### Method Retrieval: GetPaymentMethod

The `GetPaymentMethod` function takes an integer (`1` for Cash, `2` for DebitCard) and returns the corresponding `PaymentMethod` or an error if the method is not supported.

```go
func GetPaymentMethod(m int) (PaymentMethod, error) {
	switch m {
	case Cash:
		return &CashPM{}, nil
	case DebitCard:
		return &DebitCardPM{}, nil
	default:
		return nil, errors.New("payment method not implemented")
	}
}
```

## Usage

### Example Code

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"creational" // Import the creational package
)

func main() {
	// Get a payment method based on an integer identifier
	paymentMethod, err := creational.GetPaymentMethod(creational.Cash)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Process payment with the retrieved method
	fmt.Println(paymentMethod.Pay(100.50)) // Output: Paid 100.50 using Cash
}
```

In this example, `GetPaymentMethod` returns the `CashPM` type, which implements the `Pay` method. The `Pay` method processes a payment of `100.50` and returns a string that describes the transaction.
