Here's a **README.md** file explaining the difference between an **interface** and a **struct** in Go.

## **Go: Interface vs. Struct**  

### **Overview**  
In Go, both **interfaces** and **structs** are fundamental components, but they serve different purposes:  

- **Interfaces** define behavior by specifying method signatures.  
- **Structs** define data by grouping related fields.  

### **Key Differences**  

| Feature       | **Interface** | **Struct** |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Definition** | A set of method signatures that a type must implement. | A concrete data type that groups fields (variables) together. |
| **Purpose** | Provides abstraction and allows polymorphism. | Represents a specific entity with data fields. |
| **Implementation** | Methods are implemented by any type that satisfies the interface. | Can have methods but must define them explicitly. |
| **Usage** | Used to define behavior without specifying implementation. | Used to store and manage related data. |

### **Example: Understanding Interface vs. Struct in Go**  

#### **1. Defining an Interface**  
```go
// Define an interface with a method signature
type Speaker interface {
    Speak() string
}
```
- This interface requires any implementing type to define a `Speak()` method.

#### **2. Defining a Struct**  
```go
// Define a struct representing a Dog
type Dog struct {
    Name string
}
```
- A struct is a concrete data type used to store values.

#### **3. Implementing the Interface with a Struct**  
```go
// Implement the Speaker interface for Dog
func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof!"
}
```
- Since `Dog` has a `Speak()` method, it **implicitly** implements the `Speaker` interface.

#### **4. Using an Interface in a Function**  
```go
func MakeAnimalSpeak(s Speaker) {
    fmt.Println(s.Speak()) // Calls the Speak method of any type that implements Speaker
}

func main() {
    dog := Dog{Name: "Buddy"}
    MakeAnimalSpeak(dog) // Output: Woof!
}
```

### **Key Takeaways**  
âœ… **Interfaces define behavior**, while **structs define data and state**.  
âœ… A struct **implicitly implements** an interface if it defines the required methods.  
âœ… Interfaces allow **polymorphism**, enabling functions to accept different types that share common behavior.
