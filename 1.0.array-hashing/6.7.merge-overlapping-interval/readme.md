Here’s a complete and beginner-friendly **README** for your Go program, including a **detailed breakdown** of `sort.Slice()` and how the overall logic works step-by-step.

# 📁 Merge Intervals in Go

This Go program merges overlapping intervals from a list of integer pairs. Each interval is represented as a slice of two integers, e.g., `[start, end]`. If any two intervals overlap, they are merged into a single interval.

## 🧠 Problem Example

Given:

```go
input := [][]int{{1, 3}, {2, 6}, {8, 10}, {15, 18}}
```

The output will be:

```go
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

Explanation:

* `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap → merge into `[1,6]`
* `[8,10]` and `[15,18]` don’t overlap with others → stay as is

---

## 🧩 How the Code Works

### 🔹 Step 1: Sort the Intervals by Start Time

```go
sort.Slice(intervals, func(i, j int) bool {
	return intervals[i][0] < intervals[j][0]
})
```

### 🔍 Breakdown of `sort.Slice`

* `sort.Slice()` is a built-in Go function that sorts a slice using a **custom comparator**.
* Parameters:

  * `intervals`: the slice we want to sort (in this case, `[][]int`)
  * `func(i, j int) bool`: comparison function that determines the sort order

#### ⚙️ What this function means:

```go
func(i, j int) bool {
	return intervals[i][0] < intervals[j][0]
}
```

This tells Go:

> "When comparing the `i`th and `j`th interval, if the start time of interval `i` is less than that of interval `j`, put `i` before `j`."

So it sorts all intervals **by their start times** in **ascending order**.

#### 🧪 Example:

Before sorting:

```go
{{2, 6}, {1, 3}, {15, 18}, {8, 10}}
```

After sorting:

```go
{{1, 3}, {2, 6}, {8, 10}, {15, 18}}
```

This step ensures that we can then easily **merge intervals linearly**.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Initialize the First Interval

```go
current := intervals[0]
```

We keep a running `current` interval to track overlaps as we go.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Loop and Merge

```go
for i := 1; i < len(intervals); i++ {
	if current[1] >= intervals[i][0] {
		// Merge
		current[1] = max(current[1], intervals[i][1])
	} else {
		// No overlap, save and move on
		result = append(result, current)
		current = intervals[i]
	}
}
```

#### ✔️ How Merging Works:

If the current interval’s **end** is greater than or equal to the next interval’s **start**, they overlap.

Example:

```go
current = [1, 3], next = [2, 6] → merge into [1, 6]
```

Use a `max()` helper function to extend the end if needed.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Add Final Interval

```go
result = append(result, current)
```

After looping, don't forget to add the final `current` interval to the result.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Return the Result

```go
return result
```

---

## 🧪 Full Example Code

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func interval(intervals [][]int) [][]int {
	if len(intervals) == 0 {
		return [][]int{}
	}

	// Step 1: Sort intervals by the start time
	sort.Slice(intervals, func(i, j int) bool {
		return intervals[i][0] < intervals[j][0]
	})

	result := [][]int{}
	current := intervals[0]

	// Step 2: Merge overlapping intervals
	for i := 1; i < len(intervals); i++ {
		if current[1] >= intervals[i][0] {
			current[1] = max(current[1], intervals[i][1])
		} else {
			result = append(result, current)
			current = intervals[i]
		}
	}
	result = append(result, current)

	return result
}

func max(a, b int) int {
	if a > b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}

func main() {
	input := [][]int{{1, 3}, {2, 6}, {8, 10}, {15, 18}}
	merged := interval(input)
	fmt.Println(merged) // [[1 6] [8 10] [15 18]]
}
```

---

## ✅ Output

```bash
[[1 6] [8 10] [15 18]]
```

---

## 📌 Summary

* ✅ `sort.Slice()` is used to sort a 2D slice by the start value of each sub-slice.
* ✅ A single pass through the sorted list allows for efficient merging.
* ✅ This is an optimal `O(n log n)` solution (due to sorting) with `O(n)` space complexity.
