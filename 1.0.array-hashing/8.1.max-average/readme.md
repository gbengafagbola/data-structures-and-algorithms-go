Great! Below is the same explanation with a clean **visual illustration** of the sliding window process.

# 📌 `findMaxAverage(nums []int, k int) float64`

## 🧠 Problem

Find the **maximum average** of any subarray of length `k` in an integer array.

---

## 🚀 Sliding Window Technique

We avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for every subarray by maintaining a **running sum** as we move a fixed-size window across the array.

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step with Visual

Let's walk through an example:

```go
nums := []int{1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3}
k := 4
```

### 🔢 Initial State (First Window)

```
[1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]
 ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
 |___|___|___|___ k = 4

Initial sum = 1 + 12 + (-5) + (-6) = 2
maxSum = 2
```

---

### ⏩ Slide Window by 1 Step (i = 4)

```
[1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]
     ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
         |___|___|___|___

Remove nums[0] = 1
Add nums[4] = 50
New sum = 2 - 1 + 50 = 51
maxSum = 51 ✅ (updated)
```

---

### ⏩ Slide Window by 1 Step (i = 5)

```
[1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]
         ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
             |___|___|___|___

Remove nums[1] = 12
Add nums[5] = 3
New sum = 51 - 12 + 3 = 42
maxSum remains = 51 ❌
```

---

### 🧮 Final Step

Return:

```go
float64(maxSum) / float64(k) = 51 / 4 = 12.75
```

## 📈 Time and Space Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n)`
* **Space**: `O(1)`

---

## 🧩 Summary

This technique is optimal because:

* We **reuse** computation from the previous window.
* We keep our code **simple** and **efficient**.
