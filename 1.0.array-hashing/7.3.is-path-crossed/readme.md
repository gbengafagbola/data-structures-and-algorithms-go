Absolutely! Below is your updated `README.md` with **ASCII-style visualizations** to help readers understand how path crossing works in the grid:

# 🚶‍♂️ Path Re-Crossing Detector (Go)

This Go program determines whether a person walking around a fulfillment center re-crosses their path.

Each movement is based on a list of **cardinal directions**:

* `"north"` moves up (+y)
* `"south"` moves down (−y)
* `"east"` moves right (+x)
* `"west"` moves left (−x)

A path is considered **re-crossed** if the walker **visits the same position more than once**, starting from `(0, 0)`.

---

## 📦 Function Signature

```go
func IsPathCrossed(steps []string) bool
```

* `steps`: list of directions
* `returns`: `true` if the person revisits any position, `false` otherwise

## 🔍 Visual Explanation

### ✅ Example 1: Path Is Crossed

```go
IsPathCrossed([]string{"north", "east", "south", "west"}) // true
```

#### 🗺️ Grid Path:

```
Start at (0,0)
↓ north
(0,1)
→ east
(1,1)
↓ south
(1,0)
← west
(0,0) ← already visited!
```

```
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
|   | X |   |  ← (1,1)
|   | X |   |  ← (1,0)
| X | S | X |  ← (0,0) visited twice
+---+---+---+
```

✅ Returns `true` because the walker comes back to the start.

---

### ❌ Example 2: Path Is NOT Crossed

```go
IsPathCrossed([]string{"north", "north", "east", "south"}) // false
```

#### 🗺️ Grid Path:

```
(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,1)
```

```
+---+---+
|   | X |  ← (1,2)
| X | X |  ← (0,2) and (1,1)
| X |   |  ← (0,1)
| S |   |  ← (0,0) (start)
+---+---+
```

✅ Returns `false` because no location is visited more than once.

---

## ✅ How It Works (Code Summary)

* Track `(x, y)` as the person walks.
* Store visited positions in a `map[string]bool`.
* If they land on a position already in the map, return `true`.

---

## 🧪 Sample Test

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(IsPathCrossed([]string{"north", "east", "south", "west"})) // true
	fmt.Println(IsPathCrossed([]string{"north", "north", "east", "south"})) // false
}
```

## 🛠️ Complexity

* **Time**: O(n)
* **Space**: O(n)

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Robotics and autonomous navigation
* Route validation in games or delivery systems
* Avoiding unnecessary backtracking in logistics
