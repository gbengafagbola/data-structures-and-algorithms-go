# 📊 Max Consecutive Ones III — Sliding Window Solution in Go

## 📝 Problem

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`.
You can flip **at most `k` zeros** to ones.

Return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s you can obtain in the array.

---

### Example

```text
Input:  nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
```

👉 Explanation:
Flip the zeros at indices `5` and `10`:

```
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, [1], 1, 1, 1, 1, [1]]
                          ↑        ↑
```

Now the longest streak of ones is **6**.

## 🚀 Approach

We solve this problem using the **Sliding Window** technique:

1. Expand a window `[left, right]` across the array.
2. Track how many zeros are in the window.
3. If zeros > `k`, shrink the window from the left until it’s valid again.
4. Record the maximum window size.

---

### 🔎 Visualizing the Sliding Window

Suppose:

```go
nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]
k = 2
```

Step by step:

```
right → 0
[1]              → valid (zeros=0), max=1

right → 1
[1,1]            → valid (zeros=0), max=2

right → 2
[1,1,1]          → valid (zeros=0), max=3

right → 3
[1,1,1,0]        → valid (zeros=1), max=4

right → 4
[1,1,1,0,0]      → valid (zeros=2), max=5

right → 5
[1,1,1,0,0,0]    → invalid (zeros=3 > k=2)
shrink from left → [1,1,0,0,0] → [1,0,0,0] → zeros=2
window = [0,0,0], max still=5

right → 10
... continues until max=6
```

## 💻 Code Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// longestOnes returns the maximum number of consecutive 1s 
// in nums if you can flip at most k zeros.
func longestOnes(nums []int, k int) int {
    left := 0
    zeroCount := 0
    maxLen := 0

    for right := 0; right < len(nums); right++ {
        if nums[right] == 0 {
            zeroCount++
        }

        // shrink window if too many zeros
        for zeroCount > k {
            if nums[left] == 0 {
                zeroCount--
            }
            left++
        }

        maxLen = max(maxLen, right-left+1)
    }

    return maxLen
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0}
    k := 2
    fmt.Println(longestOnes(nums, k)) // Output: 6
}
```

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**:
  `O(n)` — each element is visited at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`).
* **Space Complexity**:
  `O(1)` — only counters and pointers are used.

---

## 📈 Why Sliding Window Works

The trick is that we never re-scan the entire array.
We keep a **moving window** of valid candidates and adjust it in place.

Think of it as:

* Expanding the window → greedily taking more `1`s.
* Shrinking the window → restoring validity when we have too many `0`s.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

* Sliding window is perfect for problems with **contiguous subarrays** and **constraints** (like "at most k").
* Instead of brute-forcing flips, track them dynamically.
* Time complexity reduces from `O(n²)` → `O(n)`.
