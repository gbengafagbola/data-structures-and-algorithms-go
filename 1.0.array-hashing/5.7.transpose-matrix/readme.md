# Transpose Matrix in Go

This Go package provides a function to **transpose a 2D matrix** — converting rows into columns and vice versa.

## 📦 Function

```go
func TransposeMatrix(matrix [][]int) [][]int
```

### 🔁 Transposition Logic

Given a 2D slice (matrix), the function rearranges it such that:

- Each **row becomes a column**
- Each **column becomes a row**

### ✅ Example

**Input:**

```go
matrix := [][]int{
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
}
```

**Output:**

```go
[][]int{
    {1, 4},
    {2, 5},
    {3, 6},
}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. It first checks if the input is empty.
2. It creates a new slice of slices with the number of inner slices equal to the number of columns in the original matrix.
3. It loops through the original matrix and appends elements to the appropriate position in the result.

## 📁 Usage

You can import and use `TransposeMatrix` in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    matrix := [][]int{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
    }

    transposed := TransposeMatrix(matrix)
    fmt.Println(transposed)
}
```
