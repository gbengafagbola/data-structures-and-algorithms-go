Awesome — you figured out a clean and effective solution! 🙌
Now, here's a **README** written so simply that even a **5-year-old** can understand it — with **step-by-step visual explanation**, analogy, and concept breakdown.

## 🍎 README: Putting Fruits into Baskets! 🧺

### 👶 The Problem (In Baby Language)

Imagine you have:

* A line of **fruits** 🍏🍊🍇 — some are **big**, some are **small**.
* A line of **baskets** 🧺🧺🧺 — each basket can hold only **one** fruit, but not all fruits will fit!

Each fruit must go into the **first basket** that is **big enough** for it.

If you can't find a basket that can hold a fruit, you have to **leave it on the ground**. 😢

Your job is to count how many fruits were **left out**.

---

### 🧠 How the Code Works

```go
func numOfUnplacedFruits(fruits []int, baskets []int) int {
	count := 0
	n := len(baskets)

	for _, fruit := range fruits {
		unset := 1 // assume the fruit won't be placed
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			if fruit <= baskets[i] {
				baskets[i] = 0 // use the basket (set to 0 = empty)
				unset = 0 // fruit was placed!
				break
			}
		}
		count += unset // if fruit wasn't placed, add to unplaced count
	}

	return count
}
```

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Example

```go
fruits  = [4, 2, 5]
baskets = [3, 5, 6]
```

**Step 1:**

* Fruit = 4
* First basket = 3 ❌ (too small)
* Second basket = 5 ✅
  → Put 4 into basket 5 → now `baskets = [3, 0, 6]`

**Step 2:**

* Fruit = 2
* First basket = 3 ✅
  → Put 2 into basket 3 → now `baskets = [0, 0, 6]`

**Step 3:**

* Fruit = 5
* First two baskets = 0 ❌
* Third basket = 6 ✅
  → Put 5 into basket 6 → now `baskets = [0, 0, 0]`

**🎉 All fruits placed! Answer = 0**

---

### 🧮 Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** O(n²) in the worst case (for every fruit, look at every basket).
* **Space:** O(1) extra space — no new arrays used, just modifying `baskets` in place.

---

### 📌 Key Rules to Remember

1. Each fruit goes to the **first basket that fits it**.
2. Each basket can be used **only once**.
3. If no basket fits the fruit → fruit is **unplaced**.

### 🏁 Final Output

This function gives you the number of fruits 🍎 that were **not placed into any basket** 🧺.
