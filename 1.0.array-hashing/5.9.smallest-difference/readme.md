Here’s a polished `README.md` for your Go package, explaining its purpose, usage, and the two different implementations provided:

# Smallest Difference

This Go package provides two functions to find the pair of numbers (one from each of two input arrays) with the smallest absolute difference between them.

## 📌 Features

- `SmallestDifference`: An **efficient** implementation using sorting and two-pointer technique — `O(n log n + m log m)` time complexity.
- `SmallestDifference2`: A **brute-force** implementation — `O(n * m)` time complexity.

## 🧠 Use Case

Imagine you have two lists of numbers, and you want to find a pair — one from each list — that are as close in value as possible. This is useful for:
- Matching nearest data points from different datasets
- Synchronizing signals or logs based on time offsets
- Any kind of pairwise comparison optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Since this is a standalone Go package, simply copy the code into your project. No external dependencies are needed.

### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	array1 := []int{-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3}
	array2 := []int{26, 134, 135, 15, 17}

	result := SmallestDifference(array1, array2)
	fmt.Println("Smallest Difference Pair (Optimized):", result)

	result2 := SmallestDifference2(array1, array2)
	fmt.Println("Smallest Difference Pair (Brute Force):", result2)
}
```

### Output
```
Smallest Difference Pair (Optimized): [28 26]
Smallest Difference Pair (Brute Force): [28 26]
```

## 🛠️ Functions

### `SmallestDifference(array1, array2 []int) []int`

- **Description**: Returns the pair with the smallest absolute difference using a two-pointer technique after sorting.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n + m log m)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

### `SmallestDifference2(array1, array2 []int) []int`

- **Description**: Returns the same result using a brute-force approach.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## 🧪 Tests

You can write unit tests using Go's testing package to verify behavior across edge cases like:
- Arrays with negative numbers
- Arrays of different lengths
- Arrays with duplicates
