Here's a well-structured `README.md` for your `MissingNum` Go function:

# 🔍 Missing Numbers Finder in Go

## 🧠 Overview

This project provides an implementation of a Go function called `MissingNum`, which finds the **first two missing positive integers** in a given unsorted integer slice. The function works efficiently by sorting the array and scanning it in **O(n log n)** time due to sorting.

---

## 📦 Function Signature

```go
func MissingNum(nums []int) []int
```

* **Input**: A slice of integers `nums` (unsorted, may contain duplicates or gaps).
* **Output**: A slice of **two** integers representing the **first two missing positive integers** in sequence.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sort the Input**:

   ```go
   sort.Ints(nums)
   ```

   Ensures numbers are in ascending order to help identify missing values.

2. **Track Expected Positive Integers**:
   The variable `expected` starts from 1 and is incremented step by step to track the smallest missing number.

3. **Iterate and Compare**:

   * If the `expected` number exists in `nums`, we skip over all its duplicates.
   * If not found, it's appended to the `missing` list.

4. **Stop when Two Missing Numbers Are Found**:
   The loop terminates once two missing positive integers are collected.

## ✅ Example

```go
fmt.Println(MissingNum([]int{2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10, 15}))
// Output: [1, 4]

fmt.Println(MissingNum([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}))
// Output: [6, 7]

fmt.Println(MissingNum([]int{0, 1, 1, 2, 2}))
// Output: [3, 4]
```

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

* Duplicate values are skipped.
* Negative numbers and zeros are ignored.
* Empty slice returns `[1, 2]` as the first two positive integers.

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(n log n) — due to sorting       |
| Space  | O(1) auxiliary (excluding output) |

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

* Input validation systems where missing numeric IDs must be assigned.
* Finding gaps in sequential datasets.
* As part of interview problems involving array manipulation and missing elements.

---

## 🧵 Code Snippet

```go
func MissingNum(nums []int) []int {
	sort.Ints(nums)
	missing := []int{}
	expected := 1
	i := 0

	for len(missing) < 2 {
		if i < len(nums) && nums[i] == expected {
			for i < len(nums) && nums[i] == expected {
				i++
			}
		} else {
			missing = append(missing, expected)
		}
		expected++
	}
	return missing
}
```
