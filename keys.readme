# ðŸ“Œ Essential Techniques for Solving Array Problems

## âš¡ Fundamental Approaches

1. **Sorting** â€“ Useful for ordering elements, eliminating duplicates, and enabling binary search.
2. **Frequency Counters** â€“ Use **Hash Maps** or **Arrays/Slices** to track occurrences efficiently.
3. **Multiple Pointers / Sliding Window** â€“ Optimizes two-sum, subarray, and sequence-based problems.
4. **Binary Search** â€“ Works best on sorted arrays (O(log N) complexity).
5. **Linear Search** â€“ Simple but less efficient (O(N)), useful for small or unsorted datasets.

## ðŸ›  Key Considerations for Different Problem Types

### ðŸ“Œ Sorted Input Array?
- **Binary Search** â€“ (O(log N)) for efficient lookups.
- **Two Pointers** â€“ Great for sum/pair optimization problems.

### ðŸ“Œ Need All Permutations/Subsets?
- **Backtracking** â€“ Explore all possible solutions recursively.

### ðŸ“Œ Tree-Based Problem?
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** â€“ Deep traversal, finding paths, or solving recursive tree problems.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** â€“ Best for level-order traversal or shortest path problems.

### ðŸ“Œ Graph-Based Problem?
- **DFS** â€“ Finds connected components, detects cycles.
- **BFS** â€“ Ideal for shortest path problems (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).

### ðŸ“Œ Linked List Problem?
- **Two Pointers** â€“ Fast & slow pointers for cycle detection, middle node retrieval, etc.

### ðŸ“Œ Recursion Banned?
- **Stack** â€“ Simulates recursion iteratively.

### ðŸ“Œ In-Place Modifications Required?
- **Swapping Values** â€“ Useful for sorting, partitioning, and reordering arrays.
- **Storing Multiple Values in the Same Pointer** â€“ Helps optimize memory usage.

### ðŸ“Œ Finding Maximum/Minimum Subarray or Subset?
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** â€“ Breaks down the problem into overlapping subproblems.

### ðŸ“Œ Need Top/Least K Items?
- **Heap (Priority Queue)** â€“ Extracts elements efficiently.
- **QuickSelect** â€“ Optimized selection of the Kth smallest/largest element.

### ðŸ“Œ Common String Matching?
- **Hash Map (Dictionary)** â€“ Quick lookups and frequency counting.
- **Trie** â€“ Efficient for prefix-based searching.

### ðŸ“Œ General Edge Cases?
- **Map/Set** â€“ O(1) lookups, O(N) space.
- **Sorting Input** â€“ O(N log N) time, O(1) space.

## ðŸ’¬ Key Questions to Discuss with Interviewer

1. **Can I use built-in methods?** (E.g., `sort()`, `map()`, `set()`)
2. **Is the input sorted?** If so, can we use **Binary Search / Two Pointers**?
3. **Are there duplicate values?** Should we use **Hash Maps / Sets** for optimization?
4. **Do we need to modify the input in-place?** Are there memory constraints?
5. **Should we aim for the absolute best time complexity, or is a near-optimal solution acceptable?**
