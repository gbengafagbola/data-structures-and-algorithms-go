Let's break this down step by step with visuals and an easy-to-follow explanation.

## **Understanding the Problem**
The function `lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q)` finds the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes (`p` and `q`) in a **binary tree**.

### **What is the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)?**
The **LCA** of two nodes in a binary tree is the **lowest (deepest)** node in the tree that has both nodes as **descendants**.

### **Example Tree**
```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \  / \
    6  2 0  8
      / \
     7   4
```
- If `p = 5` and `q = 1`, the **LCA is 3**.
- If `p = 5` and `q = 4`, the **LCA is 5**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Execution**
### **Step 1: Base Case**
- If the **current node is `nil`**, return `nil` (we reached a leaf node).
- If the **current node is `p` or `q`**, return that node.

### **Step 2: Recursively Search Left and Right**
- Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` for the **left** and **right** children.

### **Step 3: Finding the LCA**
- If **both left and right calls return non-`nil` values**, it means `p` is in one subtree and `q` is in the other, so the **current node is the LCA**.
- If only one side is non-`nil`, return that node (since both `p` and `q` exist in that subtree).
- If both are `nil`, return `nil` (neither `p` nor `q` is in this subtree).

---

## **Example Execution**
### **Finding LCA of 5 and 1**
```
lowestCommonAncestor(3, 5, 1)
```
1. Start at **node 3**:
   - Call left: `lowestCommonAncestor(5, 5, 1) ‚Üí returns 5`
   - Call right: `lowestCommonAncestor(1, 5, 1) ‚Üí returns 1`
   - Since both sides return values, **LCA is 3**.

```
        (3)  ‚Üê LCA
       /   \
      5     1
```

### **Finding LCA of 5 and 4**
```
lowestCommonAncestor(3, 5, 4)
```
1. Start at **node 3**:
   - Call left: `lowestCommonAncestor(5, 5, 4) ‚Üí returns 5`
   - Call right: `lowestCommonAncestor(1, 5, 4) ‚Üí returns nil`
   - Since only one side returns a value, **LCA is 5**.

```
        3
       / \
    (5)   1  ‚Üê LCA is 5
     / \
    6   2
       / \
      7   4
```

---

## **Edge Cases**
1. **One of the nodes is the LCA** ‚Üí Example: `p = 5, q = 4`, LCA is `5`.
2. **Nodes are far apart in the tree** ‚Üí Works normally.
3. **One node does not exist in the tree** ‚Üí Returns `nil`.
4. **Tree has only one node** ‚Üí The root itself is the LCA.

## **Final Thoughts**
This recursive approach efficiently finds the **lowest common ancestor** using **depth-first search (DFS)**. It ensures we explore both subtrees while keeping the solution clean and optimal.
