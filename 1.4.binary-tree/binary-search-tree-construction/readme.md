Here’s a **child-friendly, illustrated README** for your Binary Search Tree (BST) Go implementation. Think of it like a storybook for your code, breaking each method down like bite-sized snacks 🍪:

# 🍃 Binary Search Tree (BST) — Explained Like You’re 5

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is like a magical sorted tree 🌳. It helps you quickly find numbers, add new ones, or remove ones you don't need anymore. Each branch can only hold smaller or bigger numbers — it keeps things neat like a toy shelf!

---

## 📦 Structure of a BST

```go
type BST struct {
	Value int
	Left  *BST
	Right *BST
}
```

### 🍎 Think of it like:

* `Value`: The number this tree node holds.
* `Left`: A smaller number than this node lives on the left.
* `Right`: A bigger number than this node lives on the right.

Imagine:

```
       10
      /  \
     5   15
```

## 🧸 INSERT - Adding a New Number

### Code:

```go
func (tree *BST) Insert(value int) *BST {
	...
}
```

### 🍌 What It Does:

Imagine walking through a tree. At each step:

* If the number is smaller → go left 🍃
* If bigger → go right 🌿
* If the spot is empty → put your number there! 🎉

### 🍕 Example:

Insert 12 into:

```
     10
       \
       15
```

You go:

* 12 > 10 → Go Right
* 12 < 15 → Go Left → It's empty!
  Now:

```
     10
       \
       15
      /
    12
```

### ⏱ Time & Space:

* **Average**: O(log n) time, O(1) space
* **Worst** (like a stick tree 🌲): O(n) time, O(1) space

---

## 🔍 CONTAINS - Searching for a Number

### Code:

```go
func (tree *BST) Contains(value int) bool {
	...
}
```

### 🍉 What It Does:

Wants to know if a number is in the tree. So it:

* Starts at the top 🍂
* Goes left/right depending on the number 🍃🌿
* If it finds it → yay ✅
* If it reaches a dead end → nope ❌

### 🍭 Example:

Check if 12 is in this tree:

```
     10
       \
       15
      /
    12
```

Steps:

* 12 > 10 → Right
* 12 < 15 → Left
* Found 12 → Return true ✅

---

## 🧹 REMOVE - Deleting a Number

### Code:

```go
func (tree *BST) Remove(value int) *BST {
	...
}
```

### 🍒 What It Does:

Tries to find and remove a number. It handles 3 tricky cases:

### 🎈 Case 1: Node has **two children**

* Replace it with the **smallest number on the right side**
* (That’s the next bigger number)

Example:

```
     10
    /  \
   5   15
      /
    12
```

Remove `10` → replace with `12` → like magic ✨

### 🥨 Case 2: Node has **one child**

* Just plug that child in where the node was 👶

### 🍟 Case 3: Node has **no children**

* Just delete the node — nothing left behind 👻

---

## 🥕 getMinValue - Smallest Value in a Subtree

```go
func getMinValue(node *BST) int {
	...
}
```

### 🍋 What It Does:

Just keeps going **left** until there’s nothing left. The smallest number lives there.

Example:

```
     15
    /
   12
  /
 11
```

→ Smallest is `11`

## 🧠 Summary

| Operation | Purpose             | Time (Avg) | Time (Worst) |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Insert    | Add a number        | O(log n)   | O(n)         |
| Contains  | Search for a number | O(log n)   | O(n)         |
| Remove    | Delete a number     | O(log n)   | O(n)         |

## 🌳 Final Visualization

A BST keeps values sorted:

```
         10
       /    \
     5       15
    / \     /  \
   2   7   12  20
```

* Left subtree is always smaller
* Right subtree is always larger
* That’s why it’s so fast!
