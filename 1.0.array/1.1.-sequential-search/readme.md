___

> Explanation

**My thought process towards solving this algorithm was**

- loop through the entire array
- compare the i element with eevery element in the array by moving from index i = 0, to the end of the array
- return true when a match comes up.
- else return false


###### Write a method that searches for a given value in an unsorted array.
