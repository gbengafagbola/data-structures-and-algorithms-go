Sure! Let’s break down the **critical part of the code** even further and explain it in a way that’s super beginner-friendly. I’ll also format it as a **README file** so you can easily refer to it later.

## **README: Understanding the Backtracking Code**

This document explains the key part of the Go code that generates all subsets of a given array using **backtracking**. We’ll focus on the following block of code:

```go
*ans = append(*ans, append([]int(nil), cur...))

for i := index; i < len(*nums); i++ {
    // Skip duplicates
    if i > index && (*nums)[i] == (*nums)[i-1] {
        continue
    }
    cur = append(cur, (*nums)[i])
    solution(nums, ans, cur, i+1)
    cur = cur[:len(cur)-1] // Backtrack
}
```

---

### **1. `*ans = append(*ans, append([]int(nil), cur...))`**

#### What does this line do?
- This line adds the current subset (`cur`) to the list of all subsets (`ans`).
- It ensures that we store a **copy** of `cur` in `ans`, not a reference to `cur`. This is important because `cur` will change as we explore other subsets.

#### Breakdown:
- `*ans`: This is the big box that holds all the subsets we’ve found so far.
- `append(*ans, ...)`: Adds a new subset to `ans`.
- `append([]int(nil), cur...)`: Creates a **new slice** that is a copy of `cur`.

#### Example:
- If `cur = [1, 2]`, this line adds `[1, 2]` to `ans`.

---

### **2. `for i := index; i < len(*nums); i++ {`**

#### What does this loop do?
- This loop iterates through the input array (`nums`) starting from the current `index`.
- It explores all possible subsets that can be formed by adding elements from `nums` to `cur`.

#### Example:
- If `nums = [1, 2, 2]` and `index = 1`, the loop will process the elements `2` and `2`.

---

### **3. `if i > index && (*nums)[i] == (*nums)[i-1] { continue }`**

#### What does this condition do?
- This condition **skips duplicates** to avoid creating duplicate subsets.
- It checks if the current element (`(*nums)[i]`) is the same as the previous element (`(*nums)[i-1]`) and if we’re not at the starting `index`.

#### Why is this important?
- If `nums = [1, 2, 2]`, without this condition, we’d generate duplicate subsets like `[1, 2]` twice.

#### Example:
- If `nums = [1, 2, 2]` and `i = 2`, the second `2` is skipped because it’s a duplicate.

---

### **4. `cur = append(cur, (*nums)[i])`**

#### What does this line do?
- This line adds the current element (`(*nums)[i]`) to the current subset (`cur`).

#### Example:
- If `cur = [1]` and `(*nums)[i] = 2`, then `cur` becomes `[1, 2]`.

---

### **5. `solution(nums, ans, cur, i+1)`**

#### What does this line do?
- This is a **recursive call** to the `solution` function.
- It explores all subsets that include the current element (`(*nums)[i]`).

#### Example:
- If `cur = [1, 2]`, this call will explore subsets like `[1, 2, 2]`.

---

### **6. `cur = cur[:len(cur)-1]`**

#### What does this line do?
- This line **backtracks** by removing the last element from `cur`.
- It allows us to explore other subsets without the current element.

#### Why is this important?
- After exploring all subsets that include the current element, we need to remove it so we can explore subsets that don’t include it.

#### Example:
- If `cur = [1, 2]`, after backtracking, `cur` becomes `[1]`.

---

### **Visual Walkthrough**

Let’s walk through an example with `nums = [1, 2, 2]`.

#### Step 1: Start with `cur = []`
- Add `[]` to `ans`.

#### Step 2: Add `1` to `cur`
- `cur = [1]`
- Add `[1]` to `ans`.
- Recursively explore subsets starting from `1`.

#### Step 3: Add `2` to `cur`
- `cur = [1, 2]`
- Add `[1, 2]` to `ans`.
- Recursively explore subsets starting from `2`.

#### Step 4: Add `2` to `cur`
- `cur = [1, 2, 2]`
- Add `[1, 2, 2]` to `ans`.
- Backtrack: Remove the last `2` → `cur = [1, 2]`.

#### Step 5: Backtrack
- Remove `2` → `cur = [1]`.

#### Step 6: Skip the second `2` (duplicate)
- Skip adding the second `2` to avoid duplicates.

#### Step 7: Backtrack
- Remove `1` → `cur = []`.

#### Step 8: Add `2` to `cur`
- `cur = [2]`
- Add `[2]` to `ans`.
- Recursively explore subsets starting from `2`.

#### Step 9: Add `2` to `cur`
- `cur = [2, 2]`
- Add `[2, 2]` to `ans`.
- Backtrack: Remove the last `2` → `cur = [2]`.

#### Step 10: Backtrack
- Remove `2` → `cur = []`.

### **Final Result**
```
ans = [
  [],
  [1],
  [1, 2],
  [1, 2, 2],
  [2],
  [2, 2]
]
```

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Backtracking** is like exploring all possible paths in a maze. You take a step forward, explore all possibilities, and then step back to try other paths.
2. **Recursion** is used to explore all possible combinations.
3. **Skipping duplicates** ensures that we don’t generate duplicate subsets.

### **How to Use This Code**
1. Call the `subsets` function with your input array.
2. The function will return all possible subsets.

Example:
```go
nums := []int{1, 2, 2}
result := subsets(nums)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]
```
