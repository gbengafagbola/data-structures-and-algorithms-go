Sure! Let's explain it like you're a smart kid curious about puzzles.

### 🎲 The Game

Imagine you have a **long string of letters**, like `"dbca"`.

You also have **a group of friends** — say 2 of them — and you're playing a game called **"Split and Pick"**.

### 📦 How the Game Works

1. **You cut the word into pieces**, one piece for each friend.

   * But each piece has to be **at least one letter**. You can’t give someone nothing.
2. You try **every possible way** to cut the word into those pieces.

   * So for `"dbca"` and 2 friends:

     * First try: "d" and "bca"
     * Second try: "db" and "ca"
     * Third try: "dbc" and "a"
3. Every time you cut the word, you **put all the pieces into a magic box**.

   * The box now has: `"d"`, `"bca"`, `"db"`, `"ca"`, `"dbc"`, `"a"`

### 🏆 The Goal

At the end, **open the box** and look inside.

Out of all the words in the box, you want to **find the one that comes last** in the dictionary — the one that's **biggest alphabetically**.

In this case, `"dbc"` is the biggest one.

---

### 🧠 Why It's Tricky

* You can't just give everyone equal-sized pieces — you have to try **all ways** to split the word.
* The splits must be **unique**, and every friend must get **at least one letter**.
* Once you've tried **every possible split**, you look at **every piece** from all those tries.

---

### 🧪 Another Example

If the word is `"gggg"` and there are 4 friends:

* Only way to split is: `"g"`, `"g"`, `"g"`, `"g"`

Put all those into the box → \["g", "g", "g", "g"]

The biggest? Still `"g"`

### 🔍 What You're Learning

This game teaches you:

* How to **break a problem into parts**.
* How to **try all the ways** to solve it.
* And how to **pick the best answer** from lots of tries.

Awesome! Let’s walk through the code step by step — still like we're talking to a clever kid who wants to know **why** every line exists.

### 🧩 The Problem

We’re solving the game we just talked about:

* Split a word into **N parts**, each with **at least 1 letter**.
* Try **every possible way** to split.
* Put **all pieces** into a magic box.
* Return the **biggest word** in the box.

---

### 🧠 The Code

```go
func answerString(word string, numFriends int) string {
```

This is our main function.
It takes:

* a `word` (like `"dbca"`),
* and the number of friends (like `2`).

It will return the **biggest word** from the magic box.

---

### 🔮 The Magic Box

```go
	var result string
```

We’ll keep track of the **biggest word we’ve seen so far** in `result`.

---

### 🔁 The Helper Function: Backtracking

```go
	var backtrack func(start int, parts []string)
```

This is a special helper function we’ll use to **try all the ways** of splitting the word.

```go
	backtrack = func(start int, parts []string) {
```

This helper function:

* `start` is where we are in the word.
* `parts` is the pieces we’ve split so far.

---

### 🧱 Final Split Case

```go
		if len(parts) == numFriends-1 {
			if start >= len(word) {
				return
			}
			parts = append(parts, word[start:])
```

If we already split the word into `numFriends - 1` parts, then the rest of the word becomes the **last part**.
We just finish the split here.

---

### 📦 Put All Pieces in the Box

```go
			for _, part := range parts {
				if part > result {
					result = part
				}
			}
			return
```

Now we go through **all the parts in this split**.
If any part is **bigger than `result`**, we update `result`.

---

### ✂️ Try All Splits

```go
		for i := start + 1; i < len(word); i++ {
			part := word[start:i]
			partsCopy := append([]string{}, parts...)
			partsCopy = append(partsCopy, part)
			backtrack(i, partsCopy)
		}
```

This is where the magic happens:

* We try splitting at **every position** in the word.
* For each position:

  * Take the piece from `start` to `i`.
  * Add it to our current split (`partsCopy`).
  * Recursively call `backtrack` to keep going from position `i`.

---

### 🎬 Start the Game

```go
	backtrack(0, []string{})
	return result
}
```

We start the game from index `0`, with an empty list of parts.
Once the game ends, we return the **biggest word** we found!

---

### 🧪 Full Example

Let’s say:

```go
answerString("dbca", 2)
```

**Splits:**

* "d" + "bca"
* "db" + "ca"
* "dbc" + "a"

**Box contents:** \["d", "bca", "db", "ca", "dbc", "a"]

**Answer:** "dbc" ✅

---

### 🌟 Summary

This code:

1. **Tries every way** to split the word into `numFriends` parts.
2. **Puts every piece** into a virtual "box".
3. **Returns the biggest** one in dictionary order.

It’s like solving a smart puzzle using LEGO pieces: try all ways to build, and pick the coolest-looking one.
