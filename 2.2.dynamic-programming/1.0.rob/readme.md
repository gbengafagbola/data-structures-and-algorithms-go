Alright! Let's break it down with a **step-by-step explanation and visuals** to help a beginner understand how this `rob` function works.

---

### **Problem Understanding**
You are a thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has some money, represented as an array `nums`, where:

- `nums[i]` is the amount of money in the **i-th** house.
- You **cannot rob two adjacent houses** because the police will catch you.
- Your goal is to rob houses in a way that **maximizes** the total stolen money.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1**
```go
nums := []int{2, 7, 9, 3, 1}
```
You cannot rob two adjacent houses. Let's see possible choices:

| House | Money | Action |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| 1st   | 2      | Rob (Total = 2) |
| 2nd   | 7      | Rob (Total = 7) |
| 3rd   | 9      | Skip (Better option ahead) |
| 4th   | 3      | Rob (Total = 7 + 3 = 10) |
| 5th   | 1      | Rob (Total = 10 + 1 = 11) |

The optimal choice is **rob house 1, skip house 2, rob house 3, skip house 4, and rob house 5 → Total = 12**.

---

### **How the Code Works (With Visuals)**
#### **Step 1: Base Cases**
```go
n := len(nums)
if len(nums) == 1 {
    return nums[0]
}
```
- If there is only **one house**, just rob it.
- If there are **two houses**, take the maximum of the two.

#### **Step 2: Initialize Two Variables**
```go
house1 := nums[0]
house2 := int(math.Max(float64(nums[0]), float64(nums[1])))
```
- `house1` stores the best loot from **previous** houses.
- `house2` stores the best loot from **two previous houses** (ensuring no adjacent houses are robbed).

---

#### **Step 3: Loop through Remaining Houses**
```go
for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
    ans = int(math.Max(float64(house2), float64(nums[i])+float64(house1)))
    house1 = house2
    house2 = ans
}
```
**What’s happening here?**  
At each step:
1. We decide whether to **skip the current house** or **rob it** and add its money to the max of previous non-adjacent loot.
2. We update `house1` and `house2` to move forward.

---

### **Step-by-Step Visualization**
#### **Input: `nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`**
We store values in:

| House Index | Money | `house1` (prev) | `house2` (max so far) | `ans` (new max) |
|------------|-------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0          | 2     | 2              | 2                   | 2              |
| 1          | 7     | 2              | 7                   | 7              |
| 2          | 9     | 2              | 7                   | **11** (2 + 9) |
| 3          | 3     | 7              | 11                  | **11** (keep previous max) |
| 4          | 1     | 11             | 11                  | **12** (11 + 1) |

Final result: **12**.

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ This is a **dynamic programming** problem where we store previous results to avoid recomputation.  
✅ We only keep **two variables (`house1` and `house2`)** instead of using an array, reducing **space complexity to O(1)**.  
✅ The algorithm runs in **O(n) time complexity** since we loop through the list only once.  

---

### **Final Code Recap**
```go
package main

import "math"

func rob(nums []int) int {
	n := len(nums)
	if len(nums) == 1 {
		return nums[0]
	}

	house1 := nums[0]
	house2 := int(math.Max(float64(nums[0]), float64(nums[1])))

	ans := house2
	for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
		ans = int(math.Max(float64(house2), float64(nums[i])+float64(house1)))
		house1 = house2
		house2 = ans
	}
	return ans
}
```
