## Folder Structure

1. ### arrays 
   - **Sum Array**: Summation of all element in an Array
   - **Sequential Search**: Search for element x in an un-ordered list
   - **Binary Search**: Search for element x in an ordered list
   - **Largest Sum in Sub-Array**: Search for largest summation in a sub array
   - **Rotate an Array to K position**: Rotate an Array in K specified position i.e (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - **Array Waveform**: Transform an array such that neigbouring characters surronding the odd indicies are greater than or equals it.
   - **Index Array**: Sort the array from 0 to n-1, and if a value is not present in the array, then -1 is should take its place. 
   - **Sorting From 1 to n**: Sort the array from 1 to n, and if a value is not present in the array, then -1 is should take its place.
