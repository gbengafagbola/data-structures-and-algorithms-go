Got it ✅ — you want the **README** to focus mainly on the Go code, and explain the **graph concept** behind it in a very beginner-friendly way (with visuals). Here’s a proper version:

# 🌊 River Sizes in Go

This project is about finding **river sizes** inside a matrix.
Think of the matrix as a **map of land and water**:

* `1` = water
* `0` = land

We want to find all the rivers (groups of connected `1`s) and their sizes.

---

## 📖 The Concept (Graph Problem)

This is actually a **graph traversal problem**:

* Each cell in the matrix is a **node** (like a point in a graph).
* Each node can connect to its **neighbors**:

  * Up
  * Down
  * Left
  * Right
* When we move through neighbors, we are basically **walking through a graph**.

👉 That means rivers are just **connected components in a graph**.

---

## 🧩 Visual Example

Matrix:

```
[
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
]
```

Visual map:

```
1 . . 1 .
1 . 1 . .
. . 1 . 1
1 . 1 . 1
1 . 1 1 .
```

(`.` = land)

Graph view (connections between `1`s):

```
A───A       B
    │       │
    C───C───C
    │       │
E───E   D───D
```

So the algorithm finds groups (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`) and counts how many `1`s are in each.

## 🏗️ Code Walkthrough

Here’s the code again, but broken down step by step.

### 1. Main Function

```go
func RiverSizes(matrix [][]int) []int {
    visited := make([][]bool, len(matrix))
    for i := range matrix {
        visited[i] = make([]bool, len(matrix[i]))
    }

    sizes := []int{}
    for i := 0; i < len(matrix); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(matrix[i]); j++ {
            if visited[i][j] {
                continue
            }
            traverseNode(i, j, matrix, visited, &sizes)
        }
    }
    return sizes
}
```

* We make a `visited` grid (same size as the matrix) to **remember which nodes we’ve already seen**.
* Loop through every cell:

  * If not visited → explore it (`traverseNode`).

---

### 2. Traversing a River

```go
func traverseNode(i, j int, matrix [][]int, visited [][]bool, sizes *[]int) {
    currentRiverSize := 0
    nodesToExplore := [][]int{{i, j}}

    for len(nodesToExplore) > 0 {
        currentNode := nodesToExplore[len(nodesToExplore)-1]
        nodesToExplore = nodesToExplore[:len(nodesToExplore)-1]

        i, j := currentNode[0], currentNode[1]
        if visited[i][j] {
            continue
        }
        visited[i][j] = true

        if matrix[i][j] == 0 {
            continue
        }

        currentRiverSize++
        unvisitedNeighbors := getUnvisitedNeighbors(i, j, matrix, visited)
        for _, neighbor := range unvisitedNeighbors {
            nodesToExplore = append(nodesToExplore, neighbor)
        }
    }

    if currentRiverSize > 0 {
        *sizes = append(*sizes, currentRiverSize)
    }
}
```

* Start from a cell → put it in a stack (`nodesToExplore`).
* Pop a node → mark as visited.
* If it’s water (`1`) → count it.
* Add its **neighbors** (up, down, left, right) if they are not visited.
* Repeat until no more connected water is left.
* Save river size.

This is basically **DFS (Depth-First Search)** on a graph.

---

### 3. Finding Neighbors

```go
func getUnvisitedNeighbors(i, j int, matrix [][]int, visited [][]bool) [][]int {
    unvisitedNeighbors := [][]int{}
    if i > 0 && !visited[i-1][j] {
        unvisitedNeighbors = append(unvisitedNeighbors, []int{i - 1, j})
    }
    if i < len(matrix)-1 && !visited[i+1][j] {
        unvisitedNeighbors = append(unvisitedNeighbors, []int{i + 1, j})
    }
    if j > 0 && !visited[i][j-1] {
        unvisitedNeighbors = append(unvisitedNeighbors, []int{i, j - 1})
    }
    if j < len(matrix[0])-1 && !visited[i][j+1] {
        unvisitedNeighbors = append(unvisitedNeighbors, []int{i, j + 1})
    }
    return unvisitedNeighbors
}
```

* Checks neighbors up/down/left/right.
* Only adds them if they haven’t been visited yet.

This is what makes the matrix behave like a **graph**.

## 🚀 Running the Program

```bash
go run main.go
```

Output:

```
[2 1 5 2 2]
```

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This problem shows how **grids are graphs**:

* Each cell = node
* Neighbors = edges
* Rivers = connected components

Understanding this helps with:

* 🌍 Map exploration (islands, lakes, forests)
* 🎮 Pathfinding in games
* 🧮 Algorithms in AI and robotics

## 🎨 Visual Recap

1. Matrix as a grid
2. Convert to a graph (nodes + connections)
3. Run DFS → count connected nodes

👉 That’s the big picture: your Go code is simply **graph traversal (DFS)** applied to a matrix.

---

Would you like me to **add ASCII step-by-step traversal (showing the DFS visiting order)** so the newbie can literally “watch” how the algorithm walks through the grid?
