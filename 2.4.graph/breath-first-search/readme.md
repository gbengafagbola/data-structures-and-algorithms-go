Perfect 👍 Let’s make a **README.md** for your **Breadth First Search (BFS) implementation in Go**.
I’ll explain the code, include **queue state visuals**, and show traversal results.

# Breadth First Search (BFS) in Go

This project demonstrates how to implement **Breadth First Search (BFS)** on a graph-like structure using Go.

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes **level by level**, starting from the root node and visiting all its neighbors before moving to the next level.

---

## 📖 Problem Explanation

We want to traverse a tree/graph of nodes in **breadth-first order** and return the sequence of visited node names.

* Each node has a `Name` and a list of `Children`.
* BFS uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to visit.
* We start from the root node and process neighbors **from left to right**.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

```go
package main

// Node represents a graph node with a name and children.
type Node struct {
	Name     string
	Children []*Node
}

// BreadthFirstSearch performs BFS and returns the traversal order.
func (n *Node) BreadthFirstSearch(array []string) []string {
	// Initialize queue with the root node
	queue := []*Node{n}

	for len(queue) > 0 {
		// Pop the first node in the queue
		currentNode := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]

		// Add the node's name to the result array
		array = append(array, currentNode.Name)

		// Add all children of the current node to the queue
		queue = append(queue, currentNode.Children...)
	}

	return array
}
```

## 🌳 Example Graph

Let’s build this graph in Go:

```
        A
     /  |  \
    B   C   D
   /        \
  E          F
```

```go
func main() {
	// Build sample graph
	nodeA := &Node{Name: "A"}
	nodeB := &Node{Name: "B"}
	nodeC := &Node{Name: "C"}
	nodeD := &Node{Name: "D"}
	nodeE := &Node{Name: "E"}
	nodeF := &Node{Name: "F"}

	nodeA.Children = []*Node{nodeB, nodeC, nodeD}
	nodeB.Children = []*Node{nodeE}
	nodeD.Children = []*Node{nodeF}

	// Perform BFS
	result := nodeA.BreadthFirstSearch([]string{})
	fmt.Println(result) // Output: [A B C D E F]
}
```

## 🔄 BFS Traversal Process

We start from **A** and use a **queue**:

| Step | Queue State | Current Node | Result Array        |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1    | \[A]        | A            | \[A]                |
| 2    | \[B, C, D]  | B            | \[A, B]             |
| 3    | \[C, D, E]  | C            | \[A, B, C]          |
| 4    | \[D, E]     | D            | \[A, B, C, D]       |
| 5    | \[E, F]     | E            | \[A, B, C, D, E]    |
| 6    | \[F]        | F            | \[A, B, C, D, E, F] |

Final traversal order:

```
A → B → C → D → E → F
```

## 📊 Visual Queue Simulation

```
Start: Queue = [A] → Visit A → Queue = [B, C, D]
       Queue = [B, C, D] → Visit B → Queue = [C, D, E]
       Queue = [C, D, E] → Visit C → Queue = [D, E]
       Queue = [D, E] → Visit D → Queue = [E, F]
       Queue = [E, F] → Visit E → Queue = [F]
       Queue = [F] → Visit F → Queue = []
```

✅ Every node is visited in **level order**.

---

## 🚀 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`

  * `V` = number of vertices (nodes)
  * `E` = number of edges (connections)

* **Space Complexity**: `O(V)`

  * Because we store nodes in the queue.

---

## ✅ Summary

* BFS visits nodes **level by level**.
* Uses a **queue** to manage nodes.
* Traversal order for our example graph:
  **`[A, B, C, D, E, F]`**
