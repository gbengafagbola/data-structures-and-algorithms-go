Sure! Here's a **README.md** that explains the `DepthFirstSearch` method like you're teaching a 5-year-old, with a fun **visual illustration** and super-simple language.

# 🧠 Depth First Search – Explained for Newbies

## 📦 What is this?

This code helps a robot explore a tree made of names!

Each name is a **node**, and nodes can have **children** (more nodes connected to them). The robot goes to each child **one by one**, from top to bottom.

---

## 🧒 Imagine This...

Let's pretend we have a **family tree** like this:

```
         A
       / | \
      B  C  D
     / \
    E   F
```

* A is the **parent**.
* B, C, and D are **children of A**.
* B has two kids: E and F.

We want to **visit** every person in the tree **starting from A**.

## 🤖 How does the robot do it?

The robot uses something called **Depth First Search** (DFS).

That’s a fancy way of saying:

> “Go **as deep as you can** down one path, then come back and try the next one.”

### 🧭 Step-by-step path

Using our tree above, here's how the robot will walk:

```
Start at A ➡️ B ➡️ E ➡️ F ➡️ C ➡️ D
```

So, the final list the robot gives us is:

```go
["A", "B", "E", "F", "C", "D"]
```

---

## 🛠️ The Code

```go
func (n *Node) DepthFirstSearch(array []string) []string {
    array = append(array, n.Name)         // Visit this node (e.g. "A")

    for _, child := range n.Children {    // Look at each child one by one
      array = child.DepthFirstSearch(array) // Go deep into each child
    }

    return array
}
```

---

## 🧠 Simple Rules

1. 👀 Look at the current node.
2. ✍️ Add its name to your notebook.
3. 👶 For each child, repeat steps 1 and 2.
4. 📚 Keep going deep until there are no more kids to visit.
5. 🔙 Go back and try the next child.

---

## 🌳 Picture Time!

```
          A
        / | \
       B  C  D
      / \
     E   F

Robot Walk: A → B → E → F → C → D
```

---

## 💬 Summary

Think of this as exploring every **branch of a tree** before jumping to the next one. It’s like climbing down one swing, then the next, until you’ve played on them all!

You're right — let’s break it down further, step-by-step, with a deeper look into **how exactly the code works**, even behind the scenes. We’ll keep the tone friendly like we’re teaching a curious 5-year-old, but also explain the **nitty-gritty** for older kids or grown-ups reading with them.

# 📚 Depth First Search — How the Code Actually Works

## 👀 Code Recap:

```go
func (n *Node) DepthFirstSearch(array []string) []string {
    array = append(array, n.Name)

    for _, child := range n.Children {
        array = child.DepthFirstSearch(array)
    }

    return array
}
```

Let’s walk through what every part **really** does:

---

## 🔬 Step-by-step Breakdown

Imagine you call this:

```go
a.DepthFirstSearch([]string{})
```

Assume the tree looks like this:

```
          A
        / | \
       B  C  D
      / \
     E   F
```

Let’s explore how the code processes this, **line by line**, with what happens in memory.

---

### 🧩 1. `array = append(array, n.Name)`

👉 The current node (`n`) wants to **add its name** to the list.

So if `n` is "A", we get:

```go
array = append([], "A") // → ["A"]
```

So now the list looks like this:

```
["A"]
```

---

### 🧩 2. `for _, child := range n.Children {`

Now we loop through all the children. For "A", the children are:

```
["B", "C", "D"]
```

So we loop through each one:

---

### 🧩 3. First child = B → call `DepthFirstSearch(array)`

We **re-enter the same function**, now with node **B** and `array = ["A"]`.

Inside that call:

```go
array = append(["A"], "B") // → ["A", "B"]
```

Now we go into B’s children: `["E", "F"]`

---

#### 🚶 Go deeper to E:

```go
array = append(["A", "B"], "E") // → ["A", "B", "E"]
```

E has **no children**, so we return:

```go
return ["A", "B", "E"]
```

🔙 Go back to B, now we continue to F.

---

#### 🚶 Go deeper to F:

```go
array = append(["A", "B", "E"], "F") // → ["A", "B", "E", "F"]
```

F also has **no children**, so return:

```go
return ["A", "B", "E", "F"]
```

Now B is done. We return back to A:

```go
array = ["A", "B", "E", "F"]
```

---

### 🧩 4. Back at A, next child = C

```go
array = append(["A", "B", "E", "F"], "C") // → ["A", "B", "E", "F", "C"]
```

C has no children → return to A.

---

### 🧩 5. Back at A, next child = D

```go
array = append(["A", "B", "E", "F", "C"], "D") // → ["A", "B", "E", "F", "C", "D"]
```

D has no children → return to A.

---

### ✅ Final Output:

```go
["A", "B", "E", "F", "C", "D"]
```

## 🧠 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?

This code uses **recursion** — that’s like saying:

> “I’ll solve this big problem by asking my smaller friends to solve smaller parts of it.”

Each time the robot visits a node, it:

1. **Adds its name** to the list.
2. **Asks all its children** to do the same thing.

Each child goes **deep down** before returning.

This is exactly what **Depth First Search** means:

> Go deep first, finish that path, then move sideways.

---

## 🪜 Stack of Calls (Like Plates)

Recursion builds a **stack** of calls in memory.

Example stack when we hit node "E":

```
A
├─ B
   ├─ E
```

Each call is waiting for the **one it called** to finish before continuing.

---

## 💡 TL;DR

| Line                               | What it Does                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `append(array, n.Name)`            | Write down the name of the place we're at  |
| `for _, child := range n.Children` | Look at all the children (roads going out) |
| `child.DepthFirstSearch(array)`    | Let the child explore its path all the way |
| `return array`                     | Give back the full journey so far          |
