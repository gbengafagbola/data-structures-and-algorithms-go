# 📐 Area of Rectangle with Maximum Diagonal

This program finds the **area** of the rectangle that has the **largest diagonal length** among a list of rectangles.  
If multiple rectangles share the same diagonal length, the one with the **largest area** is chosen.

---

## 📝 Problem Explanation

Given a list of rectangles, each defined by its sides `[a, b]`:
- The **diagonal length** of a rectangle is:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

- Instead of comparing diagonals directly, we compare their **squares** to avoid floating-point errors:

\[
d^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

- For each rectangle:
  - Compute diagonal²
  - Compare with the maximum found so far
  - If larger, update both diagonal² and area
  - If equal, keep the one with the **larger area**

Finally, return the **area** of the rectangle with the maximum diagonal.

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough

Input:
```

\[\[4, 7], \[8, 9], \[25, 60]]

```

### Step 1: Compute diagonal² and area

| Rectangle (a,b) | Diagonal² (a²+b²) | Area (a×b) |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| (4, 7)          | 65                | 28         |
| (8, 9)          | 145               | 72         |
| (25, 60)        | 4225              | 1500       |

### Step 2: Find maximum diagonal²  
- Max diagonal² = **4225** from (25, 60)

### Step 3: Result  
- Corresponding area = **1500**

✅ Output: `1500`

## 📊 Visual Explanation

Imagine each rectangle drawn on a plane:

```

+-------------+
\|             |
\|             |
\|             |
+-------------+

Diagonal = √(width² + height²)
Area     = width × height

````

We look for the **longest diagonal** across all rectangles and return its **area**.

## 🧑‍💻 Code

```go
package main

func areaOfMaxDiagonal(dimensions [][]int) int {
    var maxDiagSq int64 = -1
    var bestArea  int64 = 0

    for _, d := range dimensions {
        a := int64(d[0])
        b := int64(d[1])

        diagSq := a*a + b*b  // diagonal squared
        area   := a*b        // rectangle area

        if diagSq > maxDiagSq || (diagSq == maxDiagSq && area > bestArea) {
            maxDiagSq = diagSq
            bestArea  = area
        }
    }
    return int(bestArea)
}
````

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Compare **diagonal²** instead of diagonals → avoids floating-point issues.
* Handle **ties** by picking the larger area.
* Use `int64` to avoid overflow when squaring large numbers.
