### Challenge: Contains Duplicate

> Problem
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.
___

> Explanation

**My thought process towards solving this algorithm was**

- create a counter to keep count of element occurence 
- iterate over the array
- check if the element is grater than 1 (hence occurence detected) then return true
- at the end of the loop and no occurence return false
