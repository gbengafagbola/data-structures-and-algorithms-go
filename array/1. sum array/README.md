### Challenge: Sum Array

> Problem
return the total collective sum of each element in an array
___

> Explanation

**My thought process towards solving this algorithm was**

- create a variable total to store the collective sum
- iterate over the array
- update the total variable with additon of the i <sup>th</sup> element to it
- return total


###### Given an array as an input argument, write a method that will return the sum of all the integer elements in the array.
