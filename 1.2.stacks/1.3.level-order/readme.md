Let's break it down visually for a beginner with an easy-to-understand explanation.

## **What Does This Function Do?**
The function **`levelOrder(root *TreeNode) [][]int`** performs a **level-order traversal** of a **binary tree** (also called **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**). It returns a list of values for each level in the tree.

---
## **Understanding a Binary Tree**
A **binary tree** consists of **nodes**, where:
- Each **node** has a value (`Val`).
- Each **node** can have a **left** child and/or a **right** child.

#### **Example Tree:**
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \   \
   4   5   6
```

The **level-order traversal** of this tree is:
```
[
  [1],     // Level 1
  [2, 3],  // Level 2
  [4, 5, 6] // Level 3
]
```

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**
### **1. Initialize a Queue**
We start with a **queue** to store nodes at each level.  
- The queue initially contains the **root** node.

```
Queue: [1]
```

### **2. Process Nodes Level by Level**
We **repeat** the following steps **until the queue is empty**:

1. Get the number of nodes in the current level (`levelSize`).
2. Process each node in the queue:
   - Remove the node from the front.
   - Store its value.
   - Add its **left** and **right** children (if they exist) to the queue.

### **Visual Representation of the Traversal**
#### **Step 1: Process Root Node**
```
Queue: [1]
Level Output: [1]
```
- Remove `1` from the queue.
- Add `2` and `3` to the queue.

```
Queue: [2, 3]
Output so far: [[1]]
```

---

#### **Step 2: Process Second Level**
```
Queue: [2, 3]
Level Output: [2, 3]
```
- Remove `2`, add `4` and `5` to the queue.
- Remove `3`, add `6` to the queue.

```
Queue: [4, 5, 6]
Output so far: [[1], [2, 3]]
```

---

#### **Step 3: Process Third Level**
```
Queue: [4, 5, 6]
Level Output: [4, 5, 6]
```
- Remove `4` (no children).
- Remove `5` (no children).
- Remove `6` (no children).

```
Queue: []
Output so far: [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
Now, the queue is empty, so we stop.

---
## **Final Output**
```go
[
  [1],
  [2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6]
]
```
This represents the **level order traversal** of the binary tree.

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Uses a Queue** â†’ Ensures we process nodes **level by level**.  
âœ… **Left to Right Processing** â†’ Always processes **left** child before **right** child.  
âœ… **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** â†’ Visits nodes in **horizontal levels** instead of depth-first.
