Your `postOrderTraversal` function is supposed to perform a **post-order traversal** of a binary tree, which means visiting nodes in this order:

1. **Left subtree**
2. **Right subtree**
3. **Root node**

However, your function has a bug: **you are not pushing nodes into `s2`**, which is meant to store the nodes in post-order. I'll explain how to fix that after going through the traversal concept.

## üå≥ Understanding Post-Order Traversal

### Example Binary Tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6
```

Post-order traversal means visiting:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Left Subtree**: `4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 2`  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Right Subtree**: `6 ‚Üí 3`  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Root Node**: `1`  

So, the expected output is:

```
[4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]
```

## üöÄ How the Correct Iterative Approach Works

Since we can't process post-order naturally using a stack (because the root comes **last**), we use **two stacks** (`s1` and `s2`):

1. **Push nodes into `s1`**, similar to a pre-order traversal.
2. **Pop from `s1` and push into `s2`**, but push **left before right**. This ensures we get the post-order sequence when popping `s2`.

### üîπ Corrected Code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type TreeNode struct {
	Val   int
	Left  *TreeNode
	Right *TreeNode
}

func postOrderTraversal(root *TreeNode) []int {
	var ans []int
	if root == nil {
		return ans
	}

	var s1, s2 []*TreeNode

	// Step 1: Push root to stack s1
	s1 = append(s1, root)

	for len(s1) > 0 {
		// Pop from s1
		x := s1[len(s1)-1]
		s1 = s1[:len(s1)-1]

		// Push to s2 (to reverse the order)
		s2 = append(s2, x)

		// Push left first, then right (reversed post-order)
		if x.Left != nil {
			s1 = append(s1, x.Left)
		}
		if x.Right != nil {
			s1 = append(s1, x.Right)
		}
	}

	// Step 2: Pop from s2 to get post-order traversal
	for len(s2) > 0 {
		y := s2[len(s2)-1]
		s2 = s2[:len(s2)-1]
		ans = append(ans, y.Val)
	}

	return ans
}

func main() {
	// Creating a test tree
	root := &TreeNode{1,
		&TreeNode{2, &TreeNode{4, nil, nil}, &TreeNode{5, nil, nil}},
		&TreeNode{3, nil, &TreeNode{6, nil, nil}},
	}

	fmt.Println(postOrderTraversal(root)) // Output: [4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]
}
```

### üé® Visualizing the Process

#### **Step 1: Insert into s1**
```
s1: [1]
s2: []
```

#### **Step 2: Move from s1 to s2 and push children**
```
s1: [2, 3]   (Push 2 first, then 3)
s2: [1]
```

```
s1: [4, 5, 3]   (Push 4 first, then 5)
s2: [1, 2]
```

```
s1: [3, 6]   (Push 6)
s2: [1, 2, 5, 4]
```

```
s1: []   (No more children)
s2: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6]
```

#### **Step 3: Pop from s2 to get post-order**
```
[4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]
```
