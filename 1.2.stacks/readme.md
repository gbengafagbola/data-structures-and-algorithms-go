# Stack Implementation in Go

## Overview
This repository contains a simple stack implementation in Go. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, allowing elements to be pushed onto and popped off the stack.

## Features
- Push elements onto the stack
- Pop elements off the stack
- Handle cases where the stack is empty

## Code Explanation
The `Stack` struct contains a slice of strings as its underlying data structure. The implementation includes the following methods:

### Methods:
- `Push(item string)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `Pop() string`: Removes and returns the top item from the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns a message indicating that there is nothing left to pop.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [Go's official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository or create a new Go file (`main.go`) and copy the code into it.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

### Expected Output
```sh
[a e i o u]
pop it all
u
o
i
e
a
NOTHING LEFT TO POP OFF
```
